Below is a step-by-step (atomic) guide for Option 1: using Replit only as your development environment, while GitHub Pages hosts your static site (with a custom domain if desired). These steps are broken down so you can feed them to an AI agent in Replit (or follow them manually).

1. Create or Open Your Repl
	1.	Go to Replit: Log in at replit.com.
	2.	Create a new Repl:
	•	Click “Create Repl.”
	•	Under “Import from GitHub,” paste your GitHub repository URL (if you already have a repo).
	•	Or select “Node.js” as a blank template, then proceed.

2. Set Up Eleventy in Replit (If Not Already in Your Repo)
	1.	Open the Shell (bottom pane in Replit).
	2.	Initialize npm (if package.json doesn’t exist yet):

npm init -y


	3.	Install Eleventy:

npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev


	4.	Update package.json (add scripts if missing):

{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "eleventy",
    "start": "eleventy --serve"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@11ty/eleventy": "^2.0.0"
  }
}


	5.	Ensure your Eleventy config (.eleventy.js) and Markdown files (.md) are present.
	•	Example: index.md, resources.md, etc.
	•	If you want Eleventy to output files to docs/ for GitHub Pages, add:

// .eleventy.js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  return {
    dir: {
      input: ".",
      includes: "_includes",
      output: "docs"
    }
  };
};

3. Develop & Preview Locally on Replit
	1.	Click “Run” in Replit’s top center.
	2.	By default, Replit might run npm start (if you set it in the .replit file).
	3.	If not, open the Shell and type:

npm start


	4.	View in Replit browser preview (on the right) or click “Open in new tab.”
	5.	Make changes to your Markdown or layout files.
	6.	Refresh the preview to see changes.

4. Commit & Push to GitHub

(If your Repl is already linked to GitHub, skip steps 1–3 below. Otherwise, do these steps to set up Git in your Repl.)
	1.	Check if Git is initialized:

git status

	•	If you see “not a git repository,” run git init.

	2.	Add remote (replace <your-username> and <repo-name> with your details):

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git


	3.	Stage & commit your files:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from Replit"


	4.	Push:

git push origin main

	•	Or git push origin master if your repo uses master as the default branch.

5. GitHub Pages Setup (If Not Done Yet)
	1.	Open your repository on GitHub.
	2.	Go to “Settings” → “Pages.”
	3.	Build and deployment:
	•	Source: Deploy from a branch.
	•	Branch: main (or master), Folder: docs.
	4.	Save. Wait ~1–2 minutes for GitHub to process and deploy.

6. (Optional) Custom Domain
	1.	In the same “Pages” section on GitHub, find “Custom domain.”
	2.	Enter your domain (e.g., example.com) and click “Save.”
	3.	DNS Setup at your domain registrar:
	•	Typically add A records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs (185.199.108.153, etc.) for @ (root)
	•	Add a CNAME for www → <username>.github.io.
	4.	Enforce HTTPS: In Pages settings, check “Enforce HTTPS.”

7. Verify Live Site
	1.	Wait a few minutes for the GitHub build and, if applicable, DNS propagation.
	2.	Visit your GitHub Pages URL or your custom domain.
	3.	Confirm your Eleventy site content matches what you see in Replit’s preview.

8. Update Workflow

Moving forward, your workflow is:
	1.	Open Replit → make changes in Markdown or layouts.
	2.	Preview with npm start.
	3.	When satisfied, commit & push changes to GitHub.
	4.	GitHub Pages auto-deploys the updated site, so your custom domain (or default GitHub Pages URL) is refreshed.

Summary of Atomic Steps
	1.	Create Repl (or import from GitHub).
	2.	Install Eleventy (npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev).
	3.	Configure package.json scripts and .eleventy.js if needed.
	4.	Develop & Preview (npm start).
	5.	Commit & Push to GitHub.
	6.	Enable GitHub Pages (target docs folder).
	7.	(Optional) Add custom domain in GitHub + DNS settings.
	8.	Repeat build/deploy cycle whenever you change content.

This setup lets you enjoy Replit’s cloud-based coding environment for your Eleventy site while GitHub Pages provides fast, free, always-on hosting.
