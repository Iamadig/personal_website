Welcome to my corner of the internet. I want to use this space to share my thoughts and other interesting content.

I enjoy building companies.

I am a curious person and I find pleasure in figuring out patterns in chaos. My curiosity takes me to explore different industries and roles.

In the past, I've led launch of DiDi in ANZ, scaled it to be the second largest rideshare company in the region. I have led commercial integration for one of the biggest CPG M&A deals in the world & founded one of the leading AI companies in data analytics for Greenfield exploration in mining.
