I recently came across this beautifully written piece on twitter on how grief is like glitter:


—


> Someone said grief is like glitter. It clings to everything. Hides in corners. Slips into your socks. Appears on your fingertips when you’re reaching for a glass of water, or brushing your hair before bed. It settles in places no one else can see. And sometimes, it sparkles. Sometimes, it doesn’t.  
> And love, in all its forms, is the reason we ever grieve at all.  
>   
> So if it hurts, maybe that’s okay. If it glitters in the dark and you cry when no one is looking, maybe that’s okay too. You are not weak for remembering. You are not broken for carrying pieces of people with you. That’s what makes you real. That’s what makes you capable of love.  
>   
> And maybe that’s the kindest thing about grief: it’s evidence that something mattered. That someone left fingerprints on your heart so brightly, the light still catches on them. That you lived a moment so fully, its echo still finds its way back into your lungs.  
>   
> Some people lose things they love—books, cities, voices, future plans—and keep walking as if nothing happened. Others crumble at the touch of a sweater sleeve or the sound of a name. There’s no proper timeline for learning how to live with what you miss. Some days you’ll do it gracefully. Other days, you’ll choke on it. That’s still living.  
>   
> And I think that’s true—not because it makes grief prettier, but because it makes it stubborn. Grief does not knock politely and leave when you ask. It spills. It stains. It stays. People imagine grief as a clean wound: blood, bandage, better. But really, it’s a messy room you can’t fully clean. A scent that lingers even after all the windows are opened. A sound you keep hearing long after the music stops.
