<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. I want to use this space to share my thoughts and other interesting content.</p>
<p>I enjoy building companies.</p>
<p>I am a curious person and I find pleasure in figuring out patterns in chaos. My curiosity takes me to explore different industries and roles.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.&quot; - Albert Einstein</p>
<p>In the past, I've led launch of DiDi in ANZ, scaled it to be the second largest rideshare company in the region. I have led commercial integration for one of the biggest CPG M&amp;A deals in the world &amp; founded one of the leading AI companies in data analytics for Greenfield exploration in mining.</p>
